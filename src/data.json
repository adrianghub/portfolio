      "summary": "I was responsible for improving test coverage for React components/utils/services. With a group of 4 teammates, I've created an MVP app (PWA) suited entirely for mobile devices.

Maps could be uploaded through the app and stored locally on each device's browser (with the help of IndexedDB). Besides, I've integrated measurements from Garmin devices with the company's internal app. Integration consists of Garmin OAuth and .fitfile conversion. There were also bugs to fix as well as new features to implement.",
